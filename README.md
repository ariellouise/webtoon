# Webtoon

Welcome Webtooner. This CLI Gem will provide you with information regarding the top digital comics from the app and website Webtoon. You can view top ten comics overall, by genre, or by age/gender selectors. After viewing a top ten list, you can select a comic on the list to view more information about the individual comic including comic title, comic author(s), comic genre, comic rating, comic description, and comic url where you can read the comic yourself.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'webtoon'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install webtoon

## Usage

To begin using the CLI gem, type `bin/webtoon` into your terminal. From there, the gem will provide you with instructions on how to make your selections.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
